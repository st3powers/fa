This repository contains scripts for the associated manuscript 
"Nutritional content of winter phytoplankton communities in a varying under-ice light environment".
The goal of the scripts contained within this repository is to support the main analyses 
presented in the manuscript. 

The manuscript uses data from the [Ecology Under Lake Ice](https://doi.org/10.5063/F12V2D1V), 
the [North Temperate Lakes LTER](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/core-datasets/), and 
[characteristic fatty acid profiles](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130053#sec015). 

The directories for this analysis need to be structured according to the tree:
```
├───Data
│   └───PLoS_supp
├───Figures
└───Scripts
```
where data are read from and written to `Data`. 

The ultimate goal of the analysis is ask:
1. How lake ice and snow cover influence the under-ice light environment,
2. How lake ice and snow cover influence under-ice algal productivity,
3. How lake ice cover is associated with characteristic algal communities, 
4. How algal communities under ice are associated with particular fatty acid profiles. 

The associated codes produce statistics and figures reported to the accompanying manuscript.
